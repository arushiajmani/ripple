# Ripple — Project Roadmap

> **Goal:** Build an interactive Python dependency analysis tool that surfaces architectural intelligence from source code using graph algorithms.

---

## How To Read This Roadmap

Each phase has a clear **entry condition** (what must be true before starting it) and **exit condition** (what must be true before moving to the next phase). Do not move forward until the exit condition is met. This discipline is what separates projects that ship from projects that stall.

The phases are sequenced so that the hardest, most important work happens first — when your energy is highest and before any UI decisions constrain your thinking.

---

## Phase 0 — Project Setup

**Duration:** 2–3 days  
**Entry condition:** None  
**Exit condition:** Empty project runs with one command, all tools verified working

### Tasks

- [x] Create GitHub repository, initialize with `.gitignore` for Python and Node
- [x] Set up project folder structure (see Architecture doc)
- [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` with three services: `backend`, `db`, `frontend`
- [x] Verify PostgreSQL container starts and is reachable from backend container
- [x] Create Python virtual environment, `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies
- [x] Create FastAPI app with a single `GET /health` endpoint returning `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [x] Create React app with Vite, verify it loads in browser
- [x] Write a `README.md` stub with setup instructions

### Deliverable

Running `docker-compose up` starts all three services. `GET /health` returns 200. React app loads at `localhost:3000`.

### Why This Phase Matters

Infrastructure problems discovered in Week 5 are catastrophic. Infrastructure problems discovered in Day 2 are a minor inconvenience. Always validate your foundation before building on it.

---

## Phase 1 — Analysis Engine (The Core)

**Duration:** Weeks 1–3  
**Entry condition:** Phase 0 complete  
**Exit condition:** CLI script analyzes a real Python project and produces correct JSON output

This is the most important phase. Everything else is presentation. If the analysis is wrong, the entire project is wrong. Take your time here.

---

### Week 1 — AST Parser

**Goal:** Parse a single Python file and correctly extract all import relationships.

#### Tasks

- [x] Implement `ASTParser` class in `backend/app/parser/ast_parser.py`
- [x] Handle absolute imports: `import os`, `import numpy as np`
- [x] Handle from-imports: `from os import path`, `from os.path import join`
- [x] Handle relative imports: `from . import utils`, `from .utils import helper`
- [x] Handle aliased imports: `import pandas as pd`, `from collections import defaultdict as dd`
- [x] Extract class definitions (name, base classes)
- [x] Extract function/method definitions (name, parent class if any)
- [x] Return structured `FileAnalysis` dataclass with all extracted information
- [x] Write unit tests covering all import forms above — `tests/test_parser.py`
- [ ] Test against at least 5 real Python files from different open source projects

#### Milestone Check

Run `python -m app.parser.cli path/to/any_file.py` and see correctly extracted imports, classes, and functions printed to terminal. For `resolved_deps`, pass the **project root** (e.g. `python -m app.parser.cli .` from `backend/`), not a package subfolder. Verify with `PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_parser.py -v` (11 cases). **pytest help:** [learn.md — Introduction to pytest](./learn.md#introduction-to-pytest). **Root convention:** [learn.md — Analysis root convention](./learn.md#analysis-root-convention).

#### Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- `from __future__ import annotations` — handle gracefully, don't crash
- Files with syntax errors — catch `SyntaxError`, log the file, skip it, don't crash the whole analysis
- Encoding issues — open files with `encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore'`
- `__init__.py` files — parse them, they often contain important re-exports
- **Wrong analysis root** — `python -m app.parser.cli ./app/parser` indexes `models.py` only; imports like `app.parser.models` then appear as `external_deps: app`. Always pass the project root (`.`, fixture root, or uploaded zip root)

---

### Week 2 — Graph Builder + Algorithms

**Goal:** Assemble parsed files into a graph and compute criticality scores.

#### Tasks

- [x] Implement `GraphBuilder` class in `backend/app/graph/builder.py`
- [x] Resolve relative imports to absolute file paths using folder structure
- [x] Handle unresolvable imports gracefully (external packages like `requests`, `numpy` — skip or add as external nodes)
- [ ] Build `nx.DiGraph` where nodes are file paths and edges are import relationships
- [ ] Implement `AlgorithmEngine` class in `backend/app/graph/algorithms/` (unified scoring entry point)
- [ ] Compute PageRank scores (`nx.pagerank`, alpha=0.85)
- [ ] Compute Betweenness Centrality (`nx.betweenness_centrality`)
- [ ] Compute composite criticality score: `0.6 * normalized_pagerank + 0.4 * normalized_betweenness`
- [x] Detect circular dependencies (`nx.simple_cycles`) — `CycleDetector` in `graph/algorithms/cycles.py` (not yet wired into `AnalysisPipeline`)
- [ ] Compute in-degree and out-degree for each node
- [x] Write unit tests using small synthetic graphs (5–10 nodes) with known correct answers — graph structure + cycle detection (`test_graph.py`, `test_cycles.py`); score assertions pending PageRank/betweenness
- [ ] Serialize graph results to JSON

#### Milestone Check

Graph structure and cycles (no scoring yet):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_graph.py tests/algorithms/ -v   # 17 tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v                  # parse → graph integration
```

**CycleDetector study + test catalog:** [learn.md — Cycle Detection](./learn.md#phase-1-week-2--cycle-detection).

When PageRank/betweenness land, re-run analysis on a 20+ file project and confirm top-ranked files match intuition.

#### Understanding The Algorithms (For Interviews)

**PageRank:** Iteratively propagates importance along edges. A file is important if many important files import it. Converges when scores stabilize between iterations. The `alpha=0.85` damping factor prevents sink nodes from absorbing all weight.

**Betweenness Centrality:** For every pair of nodes (A, B), find the shortest path between them. Count how many of those paths pass through node X. Normalize by total possible paths. High betweenness = architectural bottleneck / bridge node.

**Why normalize before combining:** PageRank and Betweenness operate on different scales. PageRank scores sum to 1.0 across the graph. Betweenness scores are much larger for big graphs. Without normalization, betweenness would dominate the composite score regardless of the weight you assign.

---

### Week 3 — Ingestion + End-to-End Integration

**Goal:** Accept a zip file upload, run the full pipeline, produce a result JSON.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `IngestionService` in `backend/app/ingestion/service.py`
- [ ] Accept zip file, extract to temp directory (`/tmp/ripple/{job_id}/`)
- [x] Walk directory tree, collect all `.py` files — via `parse_repository()` / `collect_python_files()`
- [x] Filter out virtual environments (`venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`), build artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`), test files (optional — include for now, filter later) — via `SKIP_DIRS` in `parser/models.py`
- [ ] Wire `IngestionService` → `ASTParser` → `GraphBuilder` → `AlgorithmEngine` into a single `AnalysisPipeline` class — partial: `AnalysisPipeline` wires parse → graph only
- [ ] Instrument every pipeline stage with timing: `file_discovery`, `ast_parsing` (total + per-file average), `import_resolution`, `graph_construction`, `pagerank_computation`, `betweenness_computation`, `score_normalization` — timings held on `PipelineResult`
- [ ] Add benchmark CLI: `python -m app.benchmark --repo path/to/project` — runs the pipeline and prints a formatted timing breakdown to stdout (for performance testing on large repos)
- [ ] Output complete result as a JSON file
- [ ] Clean up temp directory after analysis
- [ ] Test end-to-end on 3 different real Python projects of varying sizes

#### Milestone Check

```bash
python -m backend.app.pipeline path/to/project.zip
# Produces: result.json with nodes, edges, scores, cycles

python -m app.benchmark --repo path/to/project
# Prints per-stage timing breakdown to stdout
```

The JSON output is correct, complete, and makes intuitive sense for a project you understand.

#### The Import Resolution Problem (Explained)

When a file contains `from .utils import helper`, the `.` means "same package as this file." To resolve this to an actual file path, you need to know:

1. The path of the current file
2. The root of the Python package (where `__init__.py` lives)

Resolution algorithm:

```
current file:  myproject/auth/session.py
import:        from .utils import helper
resolved:      myproject/auth/utils.py  (same directory + utils.py)
```

For `from ..config import settings`:

```
current file:  myproject/auth/session.py
import:        from ..config import settings
resolved:      myproject/config.py  (one level up + config.py)
```

Unresolvable imports (third-party packages like `import requests`) should be tracked separately as "external dependencies" — they're useful metadata but shouldn't be graph nodes since you don't have their source.

---

## Phase 2 — API Layer

**Duration:** Weeks 4–5  
**Entry condition:** Phase 1 complete — `AnalysisPipeline` produces correct JSON for any Python zip  
**Exit condition:** All API endpoints functional and testable via Swagger UI at `/docs`

---

### Week 4 — Database + Core Endpoints

#### Tasks

- [ ] Set up Alembic for database migrations
- [ ] Implement all tables from the schema in the SRS (repositories, files, dependencies, node_scores, cycles)
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/analyze` — accepts zip file upload, creates job record, triggers background analysis
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/status/{repo_id}` — returns current job status; includes `metrics` array (stage durations) once analysis is complete
- [ ] Implement background task that runs `AnalysisPipeline` and writes results to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement idempotency — same zip uploaded twice returns existing result (hash the file content)
- [ ] Handle failures gracefully — if analysis crashes, set status to `"failed"` with error message

#### Milestone Check

Upload a zip via `curl` or Swagger UI. Poll status endpoint until `"complete"`. Verify results are stored in PostgreSQL by querying the database directly.

---

### Week 5 — Graph + Impact Endpoints

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `GET /api/graph/{repo_id}` — returns full graph JSON (nodes, edges, scores, cycles, top_critical)
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/impact/{repo_id}?file=path/to/file.py` — returns direct and transitive dependents
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/repos` — returns list of all analyzed repos
- [ ] Add proper HTTP error responses (404 for unknown repo_id, 422 for invalid inputs)
- [ ] Add CORS configuration so React frontend can call the API
- [ ] Write integration tests for all endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient`

#### Milestone Check

All endpoints return correct data. Frontend can be started and make API calls without CORS errors. Impact analysis for a known file returns the correct set of dependents.

#### The Impact Analysis Algorithm (Explained)

"What breaks if I change file X?" means: find all files that directly or transitively import X.

In graph terms: find all nodes from which X is reachable following edge direction in reverse.

```python
# In NetworkX:
dependents = nx.ancestors(G, target_file)
# Returns all nodes that have a path TO target_file
# i.e., all files that (directly or transitively) import target_file
```

Direct dependents = nodes with a direct edge to target_file (`G.predecessors(target_file)`)
Transitive dependents = all ancestors (`nx.ancestors(G, target_file)`)

---

## Phase 3 — Frontend

**Duration:** Weeks 6–8  
**Entry condition:** Phase 2 complete — all API endpoints functional  
**Exit condition:** Project is demo-ready and portfolio-publishable

---

### Week 6 — Graph Visualization

#### Tasks

- [x] Set up React project with Vite, install Cytoscape.js and react-cytoscapejs — Vite scaffold only; Cytoscape not installed
- [ ] Create `GraphCanvas` component that accepts nodes and edges as props
- [ ] Fetch graph data from `GET /api/graph/{repo_id}` on page load
- [ ] Render nodes with color encoding: red (criticality > 0.7), orange (> 0.4), green (< 0.4)
- [ ] Render node size proportional to PageRank score
- [ ] Apply force-directed layout (`cose` layout in Cytoscape)
- [ ] Enable zoom, pan, fit-to-screen controls
- [ ] Show loading state while graph data is fetching

#### Milestone Check

Real repo graph renders correctly in browser. Nodes are colored and sized by criticality. Graph is zoomable and pannable. High-criticality nodes are visually obvious without reading labels.

---

### Week 7 — Interactivity + Sidebar

#### Tasks

- [ ] Implement node click handler — selected node gets highlighted border
- [ ] On node click, call `GET /api/impact/{repo_id}?file={selected_file}`
- [ ] Highlight direct dependents in orange, transitive dependents in light red, unaffected nodes dimmed
- [ ] Build `Sidebar` component with three panels:
  - `CriticalFilesList` — top 10 files ranked by criticality score with score displayed
  - `NodeDetail` — shown when node is selected: file path, scores, in/out degree
  - `ImpactPanel` — "X files depend on this file" with list of dependents
- [ ] Build `CycleWarnings` panel — list all detected circular dependency cycles
- [ ] Add "clear selection" behavior when clicking empty canvas space

#### Milestone Check

Full interaction flow works: click a node → sidebar updates → dependents highlight on graph → clicking away clears selection. Cycle warnings show correctly if cycles exist.

---

### Week 8 — Input Flow + Polish + Documentation

#### Tasks

- [ ] Build `HomePage` with zip file upload form and recent analyses list
- [ ] Implement polling logic: after upload, poll `GET /api/status/{repo_id}` every 2 seconds until complete
- [ ] Show progress indicator during analysis ("Parsing files... Building graph... Computing scores...")
- [ ] Build `AnalysisPage` that loads when status becomes `"complete"`
- [ ] Add error states: invalid zip, analysis failed, network error
- [x] Write `README.md` with: project description, architecture overview, setup instructions, screenshots — description, architecture, and setup done; screenshots pending
- [ ] Record a 2-minute demo video showing the full flow
- [ ] (Optional) Deploy: Railway or Render for backend + PostgreSQL, Vercel for frontend

#### Milestone Check

A person who has never seen the project can clone the repo, run `docker-compose up`, and successfully analyze a Python project within 5 minutes. README is clear enough that no verbal explanation is needed.

## Version Ladder Summary

### MVP — What's Described Above

**Timeline:** 8 weeks  
**Resume claim:** "Built a static analysis tool that parses Python repositories into directed dependency graphs and applies PageRank and Betweenness Centrality to identify architecturally critical files and compute change impact, with an interactive React visualization."

### v2 — AI Explanation Layer

**Timeline:** 3–4 weeks after MVP  
**What to add:**

- `POST /api/explain/{repo_id}` endpoint
- Graph traversal to extract relevant context for a user's question
- LLM call with structured graph context as input, natural language explanation as output
- Chat panel in the frontend sidebar

**Resume addition:** "Extended with an LLM layer that generates architectural explanations grounded in graph-traversal context rather than raw code retrieval, producing structured, verifiable answers."

### v3 — Behavioral Coupling (Stretch Goal)

**Timeline:** 4–6 weeks after v2  
**What to add:**

- Git history analysis using `gitpython`
- Co-change coupling matrix: files that change together frequently
- New edge type in graph: "behavioral coupling" vs "structural coupling"
- Surface files with high behavioral coupling but low structural coupling as "hidden dependencies"

**Resume addition:** "Implemented behavioral coupling analysis by correlating git co-change history with structural dependency graphs, identifying hidden architectural dependencies not visible in import relationships."

*Roadmap version: 1.1 | Project: Ripple | Last updated: June 2026*
